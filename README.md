<!--
Why limit rendering to screens? Exploring rendering content on to origami
-->


## Features

<!--
Origami => Paper folding. Why not render content on to paper, fold it up in interesting ways, and make the content come alive?

This module uses the light module templates generated out of default prototype to render content within an SVG base file.

The svg base file is vector graphics of an origami's crease lines.

The resultent SVG image, contains CMS content rendered withn crease lines of the origami.

The image, when printed on paper could be folded as origami displaying the CMS content of interest.

Marketers could even render content onto a scented origami craft paper; Fold them up and use them as a Digital/Physical Experience component.

## Usage

<!--
The lght module creates a content type called origami.
The module provides a component named 'say-it-with-origami'
Authors wanting to include origami rendering could use the 'say-it-with-origami' component.
It is very similar to including image or video in content.

Choose the origami shape on to which content is to be rendered using the shape drop down.
Presently limited to Prism, Cube, (soon) Tetrahedron. [ If there is enough interest, this library of shapes will get enriched in the future]
-->
Magnolia CMS typically renders HTML. 
Page template code contains the exact html to be output.
HTML indeed is XML, and SVG is also XML. Thus rendering as SVG is a engineering no-brainer.
Yet, in marketers hand, origami rendering could be a powerful addition to their tool kit.
